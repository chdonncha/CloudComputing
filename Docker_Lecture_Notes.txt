# Docker Notes

### Cloud computing problems:
hardware infrastructures are different, differences
need to be managed. A software component is used to bridge the services that
sit on top of the hardware layer.
Problem associated with cloud computing: Interoperability.

 -**

### Interoperability:
It is a massive issue. They may have dependencies or inter-dependencies where
they won’t work with each other. Like modifying one piece or software might
bring down an entire stack.

Isolation of software can be used to try and prevent inter-dependencies. We
have a complex software system to ensure that all the virtual servers aren’t
dependant on each other.

Interoperability was solved by introducing a standardised container. We can put
whatever we want in the container, and it’s sealed from the rest of the
software to we can take it out when we need it.

If we ship in containers, docker is a shipping container for source code, we
solve the Interoperability issue by giving a standard way of putting code into
an interface, which we can ship around to where we want.

### Docker

Runs virtually on a linux server

There are many other software that use a similar approach to docker.
The project aims to encapsulate the data in a linux environment through
encapsulation.

It allows us to build complex multi-node environments.

We can install a webserver onto one container and we can build an API to
get a webserver and cloud server to work with each other as long as the API
stays the same.

They can be then shipped to verious platforms and then build and implemented

We can use this container service anywhere where the docker software is
installed.

Decoupling becomes a big issue. Build small lightweight containers.
We can make the life cycle easy and consistant if we seperate everything out
to containers, this is to avoid complex interactions between the containers.

With a container we create all the software and configurations to run that
software. This is so a device with specific configurations won't have to
worry about it as the container will run in its own environment
with its own provided configurations, and it is light on the load of the
device.

We can isolate peices of software from one another.

### Why care? - Benefits of a Containerised System:

-**

 * Support segregation of duties
 * Improves the speed and realiability of continous deployment and
 continuous integration systems
 * Significant preformance, costs, deployment, and portability
 issues normally associated with VMs

### In summary:

-**

A container is a small lightweight description of services
and inside of that container we can then build an applciation with
a specific API and then link those containers together to create
well constructed, resiliant software stacks

It offers a build ship and run model.

You can install customised packages.

Open and close ports.

### Docker vs Vitrual Machine:

Differences between sharing of operating system components within containers
them selves.

<strong> Traditional Server: </strong>
  * Has a host operating system
  * Hypervisor to facilitate virtual instances on top of that.

To have multiple copies of that application running on a server you have to fully
replicate the guest operating systems and the libraries associated with that,
almost like running a full PC.

Docker shares libraries and packages where appropriate

 * The container comprises an application and its dependencies
 * Containers serve to isolate processes which run in the solation
 in userspace on the host's operating system.
 * Traditional, hardware virutalisation, aims to create an entire
 virutal machine

If we wanted to do that in <em><strong> VMware, KVM, Zen, EZ2 </em></strong>
you have to create a full stack of all the software required for that
virutalisation.

It massively increases the deployment size compared to docker due to lack of
reuse of software.

With a traditional VM, each application, each copy of an applicaiton,
and each slight modification of an application requires creating an
entirely new VM

A new application on host need only have the application and its
binaries/libraries

They are basically shared in the same space to allow the containers to work
more efficently.

-**

### Making copies

Traditional VM coppies require a Guest OS (takes the most harddisk space),
Bins/Libs & App A.

In Docker the copying of the Bins/Libs & App A are only required.

-**

### Testing and Qualification

Service update must be tested and qualified

Delta between an update and previously working configuration should be
small - operations objective

Invariably conflicts with the need to patch and advance the underlying
software - developer's objective

-**

### Update Example (Contrived)

Web service is running a version of PostgreSQL with a particular version
of Memcached (a memory cache)

Each service is known to work with a particular OS version, say
Ubuntu 12.04

A critical fix is required for PostgreSQL but that update will only work
with a later version of Ubuntu

The server OS would need to be updated but that update is not qualified
to work with the current version of Memcached

A newer version of Memcached would be need too
  - This is known as dependency cascade

-**

### Update Example (cont'd)

To make matters worse, new version of Memcached would not work
with the middleware version it services.

Now we could have further upstream dependency cascades.

 * <strong> Solution #1: </strong> Split Memchached and PostgreSQl services onto
 different VMs
  * Further complicates the development mesh
  * Forces singl-role-per VM policy, reducing flexibility
 * <strong> Solution #2: </strong> Containerise the PostgreSQL and Memcached
 services inside Docker

-**

### How Docker Works:

Starting with a base image, say some version of Ubuntu, the developer
can build a bespoke container for hosting a single component, say PostgreSQL

The build image encapsulates the OS version, updates, libraries and
application components

Docker can animate the image into a running conttainer

The container transparently runs a fully isolated OS instance within the host
machine

Resources outside the container are not visable to anything inside

-**

### How Docker Works (cont'd):

Docker images are built on union filesystem (AUFS)

Supports TCP/IP port mapping and forwarding.

-**

### Automated Image Building

* Docker supports automated, script-driven image generation
* A docker file specifies the following:
  * Base Linux image
  * Individual software installation commands
  * TCP/IP ports to expose
  * Default command(s) to execute when the container is run

Docker also is supported by nitrous.io

### Docker vs Virtual Machines Summary

<strong>Traditional VMs:</strong>

 * Heavy and slow in compreson to docker system
 * takes full guest operating system for the basic requirement from which you
 build your application on

<strong>Docker:</strong>

* allows each container to share each library within each library within the
userspace so they be started and stopped very quickly and can be deployed much
more efficently
